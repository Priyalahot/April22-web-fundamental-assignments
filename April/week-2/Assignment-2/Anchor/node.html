            <h3>What is Node.js?</h3>
            <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser. Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration, version 15.14, was released in April 2021. Developers use Node.js to create server-side web applications, and it is perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.</p>

            <h3>Why Node.js?</h3>
           <p class="sub">Node.js has become the de facto tool for developing server-side and network applications. Here is why:</p> 
            <ol>
            <li>Node.js is really fast: Having been built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, its library is extremely fast for code execution.</li>
            <li>Node Package Manager (NPM): Node Package Manager has more than 50,000 bundles, so whatever functionality is required for an application can be easily imported from NPM.</li>
            <li>Node.js uses asynchronous programming: All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous (i.e., non-blocking), so a Node.js-based server does not wait for the API to return data. The server calls the API, and in the event that no data is returned, the server moves to the next API the Events module of Node.js helps the server get a response from the previous API call. This also helps with the speed of Node.js.</li>
            <li>No buffering: Node.js dramatically reduces the processing time while uploading audio and video files. Node.js applications never buffer data and simply output the data in chunks.
            </li>
            </ol>
