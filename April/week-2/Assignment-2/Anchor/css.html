            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
            <p> CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

                A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
                
                Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.</p>

            <h3>How CSS is structured:</h3>
            <ol>
            <li><b>External stylesheet :</b>
                An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external stylesheet to our web page.
            </li>
            <li><b>Internal stylesheet :</b>
                An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a style element contained inside the HTML head</li>
            <li><b>Inline styles :</b>
                Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like this </li>
           <p>As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module.</p>
