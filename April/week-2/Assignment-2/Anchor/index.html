            <h3>What is Html?</h3>
            <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>The main parts of our element are as follows:</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
            <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
            <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
            <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li></ol>
